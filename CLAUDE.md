# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
# Backup
- Be sure to take a back up of a file before making change to it.
- Maximum backups of a file is 3, then start overwrite once it reaches 3.
# Documentation
- Document the design changes
